Introduction:
Made by Veda. This is my very first attempt at writing code in my life. 

State of my project:
Key learnings so far:
The focus for me over the past two days, was to gain a clear understanding of the languages that we were going to worth with, before I even begin. As I was going through the page with alot of trial and error I realized that there are certain trends and patterns which I am now slowly picking up, these are mainly functions like color, width and size, and how to link text,
- How to setup a system between Github and Brackets to begin a project
- Creating a style sheet, understanding classes (for styling multiple elements) and id's (for styling singular elements)
- Uploading a transparent image with custom margins andsizing
- Creating custom spacing between sections
- Creating horizontal lines with custom width
- Creating a textbox with custom font and space styling, and container size
- Creating links with custom fonts and colours
- Creating a button with hover state
- Creating a dropdown with custom styling and content

Next steps:
- To learn how to link images and videos
- To create a range of circles on the page with a hover state of a pop-up (this is to showcase the network with names)
- To create a notification system within the browser
- To create a new page with a full profile and to link this from the home page
